# Schelling-s-Dynamic-Models-of-Segregation
This project simulates Thomas Schellingâ€™s Dynamic Models of Segregation using agent-based modeling. Starting with a basic version, it progressively builds complexity, adding richer agent behaviors and environmental context. The final version integrates EDSL for enhanced simulation of qualitative agent interactions and decision-making.
